    <h5><b>What it's about:</b></h5>

    <p>The Pythagorean Therom is a therom created by Pythagoras. The Therom says: for any triangle with side lengths a, b, and c, <b>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</b>.</p>
    <h5><b>Why I like it:</b></h5>
    <p>The Pythagorean Therom can be used in so many ways from constructing stable buildings to trianglulating GPS coordinates.</p>
